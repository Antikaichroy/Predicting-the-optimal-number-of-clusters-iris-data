# Predicting-the-optimal-number-of-clusters-iris-data
# Project Overview
This project focuses on clustering the Iris dataset to identify the optimal number of clusters and visualize the results. The project follows these key steps:

1. Library Imports: Initially, the necessary Python libraries were imported to facilitate data handling, visualization, and clustering.

2. Dataset Loading: The Iris dataset was loaded, providing the foundation for analysis and model training.

3. Initial Visualization: A scatter plot was used to visualize the dataset, but no clear distinction between clusters was observed.

4. Elbow Method: The Elbow method was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). This involved plotting the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) against different values of k to identify the point where the SSE begins to diminish significantly, suggesting the optimal k.

5. K-Means Clustering: The model was trained using K-Means clustering, which resulted in three distinct clusters for the Iris data.
